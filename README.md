# pytest-recipes

This repository contains several `pytest` recipes explaining how to mock or monkeypatch different types of objects.

At the moment, recipes exist for:
  - [Mocking a config](/mock-config/)
  - [Monkeypatching a method's parameter](/monkeypatch-method-parameter/)
  - [Monkeypatching the return value of a function](/monkeypatch-return-value/)
  - [Monkeypatching datetime methods by injecting functions](/monkeypatch-datetime/)

The [how-to](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/how-to/index.html) guides from the official documentation are also particularly useful.
