# Monkeypatch a return value

This is an example showing how to monkeypatch the result value of a function using `patch()` from `unittest.mock`. Two methods are shown: one with a decorator and one with a fixture.

# Usage

Create a virtual environment and install the dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install pandas pytest
```

Run the main script with:

```bash
python -m main
```

Run the test with:

```bash
pytest
```
